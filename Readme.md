### `Graph Path` 

## Compiled by team `No Cap`

## `Introdution`
Graph Path is a project management tool that represents task in a form of a 
directed acyclic graph. The representation is chosen because it is intuitive
and the graph will clearly layout the paths that are critical paths. 
A graph can have alternate paths to another node from the start node. 
This would gives a visual stimuli of how the project flows from node to node.
